### Completeness

Table 1 shows the percentage of records for each field in the sample that contain data. While we have not verified that these all contain *useable* data it is nonetheless obvious that some, like Abstract and Institution (and, of course, Author and Title) are effectively complete, while others, such as Supervisor, Funder or DOI, are poorly populated at best. Across the *full* EThOS data set  the DDC is nowhere near as well-populated as in our selected sample (the same holds for some of the other fields), but thatâ€™s because we purposively chose records that would enable us to validate our approach against the expert-assigned label.
